# SpamAware

This project implements a machine learning model for SMS spam classification. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages into two categories: "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages and is deployed for use with a user-friendly interface.

## Features



Spam Message Classification: Classify messages as either spam or not spam.

Text Preprocessing: Includes text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Machine Learning Model: The model is trained using a dataset of labeled messages and is capable of predicting whether a new message is spam or not.

Streamlit Interface: A simple web interface built with Streamlit to interact with the classifier in real-time.
## Tech Stack

Python: Programming language used for implementing the project.

NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing and tokenization.

scikit-learn: Library for building and evaluating the machine learning model.

Streamlit: Framework for creating the interactive web interface.

Pandas: For data manipulation and processing.

NumPy: For numerical operations
